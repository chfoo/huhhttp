    <P>~Welcome back!
    <P>I want to tell you why i created this Web Site. The story is very
    long I hope you don‚Äôt fall asleep! A few days ago I went in a walking
    trip in the near by forest. I got lost and found this large
    castle! It was very strange because this was in Canada. I went when I
    went inside, I saw all this gold coins and jewerlery. I went
    very deep inside the castle and then I saw Smaug sleeping. I went up
    to him and woke him up by throwing coins at him. He asked me who I
    was and why I wake him up. His breath smelled like pennys that
    are in a fountan for too long. I said I got lost and he smells like
    pennys. I asked him why he was in Canada and he got confused.
    He said we are in Little Earth and I got confused too. I had a chocolate
    and gave it too him but it melted as soon as it went on his tongue and
    we became friends!!><IMG SRC="/smiley/smiles1.gif">

    <p>Greetings from the future! The Space-Time Portaling Device was

    In all seriousness, Smaug and I

    the machine as we tunneled. We expect the machine to drift through
    time within
    the next few years and hopefully arrive within a 500 km radius.</p>

    hybrid. Smaug side of me keeps complaining that we are much too small

    <p>Well anyway, <i>There is a coin stuck between our teeth.</i> the
    time traveling machine required immense resources that the world
    eventually collapsed. So here is our plan. We need to funds to rebuild

    <p>If you truely believe in Smaug, then you‚Äôll believe in Bitcoins.
    <i>I love Bitcoins.</i>
    <h3>What are Bitcoins?</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin is digital currency. It‚Äôs money but done through the internet.
    <i>Use Bitcoin.</i>
    <h3>Where can I get Bitcoins?</h3>
    <p>You can get Bitcoins through a Bitcoin currency exchange like
    <a href="http://mtgox.gox">Mt. Gox.</a>. Exchange your worthless cash
    to Bitcoins. <i>Buy Bitcoins.</i>
    <h3>How can I use Bitcoins?</h3>
    <p>To use Bitcoins, you will need the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.com/bitcoin_bitcoins_BITCOINS!">
    Bitcoin Software Client</a>. It‚Äôs free and always will be. This software
    provides your Bitcoin wallet. The software is also used to send and
    receive money. These are called transactions. <i>Give me your wallet.</i>
    <h3>But what gets exchanged?</h3>
    <p>Unlike physical money, Bitcoin transactions are published anonymously
    on the internet. But don‚Äôt worry, Bitcoin does not identify anyone.
    Instead, special addresses are generated by the Bitcoin software. If you‚Äôd
    like to receive Bitcoins, your software will generate a random bunch
    of letters. That is actually a Bitcoin address that you will provide
    to the sender. The same goes for sending Bitcoins. The receiver will
    provide you with an address to send. <i>I can see how much money will
    leak to me.</i>
    <h3>Won't people just forge transactions?</h3>
    <p>No, it is impossible. Your wallet is proof that you own your
    Bitcoins made through the transactions. These transactions are
    grouped into blocks and build on top of each other.
    Transactions blocks are published and verified by all
    Bitcoin users.
    <p>Your software will do this for you to prevent malicious
    ‚Äúdouble-spending‚Äù. Once your transaction has been confirmed by
    <s>6</s> 1 blocks, you can be assured your transaction is permanent and
    not malleable. <i>Ha ha ha.</i>
